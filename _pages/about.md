I am a 4th year Ph.D. student, working under Dr. [Chang-Tien Lu](http://www.nvc.cs.vt.edu/~ctlu/) at the [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/) in Virginia Tech. My research is focused on a range of topics in event detection / prediction and associated applications such as civial unrest detection, airport threat detection, transit disruption detection, and emerging science and technology (S&T) prediction.
