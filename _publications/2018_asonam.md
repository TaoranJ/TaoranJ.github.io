Abstractâ€”With the rapid growth in urban transit networks inrecent  years,  detecting  service  disruptions  in  a  timely  manneris  a  problem  of  increased  interest  to  service  providers.  Tran-sit  agencies  are  seeking  to  move  beyond  traditional  customerquestionnaires and manual service inspections to leveraging opensource indicators like social media for deteting emerging transitevents. In this paper, we leverage Twitter data for early detectionof metro service disruptions. Inspired by the multi-task learningframework,  we  propose  the  Metro  Disruption  Detection  Model,which  captures  the  semantic  similarity  between  transit  lines  inTwitter space. We propose novel constraints on feature semanticsimilarity  exploiting  prior  knowledge  about  the  spatial  connec-tivity  and  shared  tracks  of  the  metro  network.  An  algorithmbased on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)framework  is  developed  to  solve  the  proposed  model.  We  runextensive  experiments  and  comparisons  to  other  models  withreal world Twitter data and transit disruption records from theWashington  Metropolitan  Area  Transit  Authority  (WMATA)  tojustify  the  efficacy  of  our  model.
